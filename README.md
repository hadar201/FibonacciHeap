# Fibonacci Heap – Data Structures Course Project

This repository holds a simple Java implementation of a **Fibonacci heap**. The code was written as part of a university data structures course to practise building and using advanced heap‑based priority queues.

Fibonacci heaps maintain a collection of heap‑ordered trees. They support efficient merge, insert, find‑minimum and decrease‑key operations, while extract‑minimum runs in logarithmic time.

## About this project

- **Course:** Data Structures
- **Language:** Java
- **Purpose:** Implement and test a Fibonacci heap as coursework

This README is intentionally brief; the focus of this repository is the source code submitted for the assignment.
